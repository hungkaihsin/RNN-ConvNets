# RNN-and-ConvNets
## Introduction


This project implements **RNN** and **ConvNet** models, and compares their performance to determine which model performs better.  
All requirements and specifications are provided in the `AssignmentNN_RNN_CNN1d.pdf` file.

Special thanks to the **MS in Data Science program at the University of the Pacific** and **Professor Anahita** for providing the resources and guidance that helped me dive deeper into the field of Machine Learning.

## Environment

This project uses:
```
Python == 3.12.10
```
